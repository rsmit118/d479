          <h2>Welcome to Taniti</h2>
          <p>
            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island
            has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and
            includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
            tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a
            small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
            20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian
            economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.

            There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of
            bed and breakfasts. All types of lodging are strictly regulated and
            regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Entertainment:</strong> Most people visit Taniti to enjoy
            the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the volcano. Other
            activities include visiting a local history museum, chartered
            fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, pubs, a
            microbrewery, a new dance club, movies, helicopter rides, an arcade,
            art galleries, and bowling. A nine-hole golf course is expected to
            be operational next year. Many of these activities are located in
            Merriton Landing, a rapidly developing area on the north side of
            Yellow Leaf Bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sightseeing:</strong> Most tourists spend time in Taniti
            City, which boasts native architecture and white sandy beaches
            encircling Yellow Leaf Bay. Popular activities include boat or bus
            tours, rainforest hikes, and visits to Taniti’s active volcano.

            though a small cruise ship docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night
            per week. Taniti’s small airport accommodates small jets and
            propeller planes, and it is currently expanding to allow larger jets
            in the future.

            found near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available for rent,
            with helmets required by law. Taniti City is flat and walkable, and
